Project: Pulling Outlook Events Using the Microsoft Outlook API

Objective The primary objective of this project is to create a system that can fetch events from Microsoft Outlook using the Outlook API. This system will enable users to retrieve their calendar events programmatically and integrate them into other applications or workflows.

Project Scope API Integration: Connect to the Microsoft Outlook API to access calendar events. Authentication: Implement secure authentication to access the user's Outlook account. Event Retrieval: Develop functionality to pull event details such as date, time, subject, location, and participants.

Data Handling: Store and process the retrieved event data for further use on MS Sql server

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for API requests and data processing.

Implementation Steps Set Up Microsoft Azure Application: Register a new application in the Azure portal. Configure API permissions for Microsoft Graph to access calendar events. Generate client ID and client secret for authentication.

Authentication Flow: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication to obtain access tokens. Securely store and manage tokens for accessing the Outlook API.

API Requests: Use the Microsoft Graph API to fetch calendar events. Implement functions to handle GET requests for event data.

Data Processing: Parse the JSON responses from the API. Extract relevant event details (e.g., subject, start time, end time, location, attendees).

Error Handling: Implement try-catch blocks to handle API request failures. Log errors and provide meaningful error messages.

Documentation and Testing: Document the setup and usage instructions. Write test cases to validate the functionality of the system. Conduct thorough testing to ensure reliability.

Tools and Technologies Programming Languages: Asp.Net ,C#,HTML ,CSS, React, JavaScript, HTTP, JSON parsing,postman,Swagger. APIs: Microsoft Graph API. Authentication: OAuth 2.0. Data Storage: Local storage ,cloud-based storage solutions or Ms SQL server , depending on the project's requirements.

Conclusion This project aims to provide a seamless way to access and manage Outlook calendar events through the Microsoft Outlook API, create a robust system for integrating Outlook events .
